# Job uniqueness for ActiveJob
[![Build Status](https://github.com/veeqo/activejob-uniqueness/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/veeqo/activejob-uniqueness/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/activejob-uniqueness.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/activejob-uniqueness)

The gem allows to protect job uniqueness with next strategies:

| Strategy | The job is locked | The job is unlocked |
|-|-|-|
| `until_executing` | when **pushed** to the queue | when **processing starts** |
| `until_executed` | when **pushed** to the queue | when the job is **processed successfully** |
| `until_expired` | when **pushed** to the queue | when the lock is **expired** |
| `until_and_while_executing` | when **pushed** to the queue | when **processing starts**<br>a runtime lock is acquired to **prevent simultaneous jobs**<br>*has extra options: `runtime_lock_ttl`, `on_runtime_conflict`* |
| `while_executing` | when **processing starts** | when the job is **processed**<br>with any result including an error |

Inspired by [SidekiqUniqueJobs](https://github.com/mhenrixon/sidekiq-unique-jobs), uses [Redlock](https://github.com/leandromoreira/redlock-rb) under the hood.

## Installation

Add the `activejob-uniqueness` gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'activejob-uniqueness'
```

If you want jobs unlocking for Sidekiq Web UI, require the patch explicitly. [**Queues cleanup becomes slower!**](#sidekiq-api-support)
```ruby
gem 'activejob-uniqueness', require: 'active_job/uniqueness/sidekiq_patch'
```

And run `bundle install` command.

## Configuration

ActiveJob::Uniqueness is ready to work without any configuration. It will use `REDIS_URL` to connect to Redis instance.
To override the defaults, create an initializer `config/initializers/active_job_uniqueness.rb` using the following command:

```sh
rails generate active_job:uniqueness:install
```

## Usage


### Make the job to be unique

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # new jobs with the same args will raise error until existing one is executed
  unique :until_executed

  def perform(args)
    # work
  end
end
```

### Tune uniqueness settings per job

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # new jobs with the same args will be logged within 3 hours or until existing one is being executing
  unique :until_executing, lock_ttl: 3.hours, on_conflict: :log

  def perform(args)
    # work
  end
end
```

You can set defaults globally with [the configuration](#configuration)

### Control lock conflicts

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # Proc gets the job instance including its arguments
  unique :until_executing, on_conflict: ->(job) { job.logger.info "Oops: #{job.arguments}" }

  def perform(args)
    # work
  end
end
```

### Control redis connection errors

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  # Proc gets the job instance including its arguments, and as keyword arguments the resource(lock key) `resource` and the original error `error`
  unique :until_executing, on_redis_connection_error: ->(job, resource: _, error: _) { job.logger.info "Oops: #{job.arguments}" }

  def perform(args)
    # work
  end
end
```

### Control lock key arguments

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  unique :until_executed

  def perform(foo, bar, baz)
    # work
  end

  def lock_key_arguments
    arguments.first(2) # baz is ignored
  end
end
```

### Control the lock key

```ruby
class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
  unique :until_executed

  def perform(foo, bar, baz)
    # work
  end

  def lock_key
    'qux' # completely custom lock key
  end

  def runtime_lock_key
    'quux' # completely custom runtime lock key for :until_and_while_executing
  end
end
```

### Unlock jobs manually

The selected strategy automatically unlocks jobs, but in some cases (e.g. the queue is purged) it is handy to unlock jobs manually.

```ruby
# Remove the lock for particular arguments:
MyJob.unlock!(foo: 'bar')
# or
ActiveJob::Uniqueness.unlock!(job_class_name: 'MyJob', arguments: [{foo: 'bar'}])

# Remove all locks of MyJob
MyJob.unlock!
# or
ActiveJob::Uniqueness.unlock!(job_class_name: 'MyJob')

# Remove all locks
ActiveJob::Uniqueness.unlock!
```

## Test mode

Most probably you don't want jobs to be locked in tests. Add this line to your test suite (`rails_helper.rb`):

```ruby
ActiveJob::Uniqueness.test_mode!
```

## Logging

ActiveJob::Uniqueness instruments `ActiveSupport::Notifications` with next events:
* `lock.active_job_uniqueness`
* `runtime_lock.active_job_uniqueness`
* `unlock.active_job_uniqueness`
* `runtime_unlock.active_job_uniqueness`
* `conflict.active_job_uniqueness`
* `runtime_conflict.active_job_uniqueness`

And then writes to `ActiveJob::Base.logger`.

**ActiveJob prior to version `6.1` will always log `Enqueued MyJob (Job ID) ...` even if the callback chain is halted. [Details](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37830)**

## Testing

Run redis server (in separate console):
```
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Run tests with:

```sh
bundle
rake
```

## Sidekiq API support

ActiveJob::Uniqueness supports Sidekiq API to unset job locks on queues cleanup (e.g. via Sidekiq Web UI). Starting Sidekiq 5.1 job death also triggers locks cleanup.
Take into account that **[big queues cleanup becomes much slower](https://github.com/veeqo/activejob-uniqueness/issues/16)** because each job is being unlocked individually. In order to activate Sidekiq API patch require it explicitly in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'activejob-uniqueness', require: 'active_job/uniqueness/sidekiq_patch'
```
